# vite-plugin-remix

Use Create API routes from path directory like to [NextJS API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), but this plugin extends the funcionality for backend development using vite.

## Motivation

- I will tried to simplify the configuration project.
- Convert the directory tree to route rules.
